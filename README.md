This repository contains the fonts created by me. This includes **Exodia** and **FProject**. While **Exodia** is a handwritten type font, (actually a protofont, and thus ugly) it still includes support for writing in [Bengali!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali) (and the Bengali part isn't that ugly! :) ).
**FProject**, on the other hand is a nice geometric/gothic sans font, with some mathematical operators and greek and some punctuation. I'm interested in adding some more useful characters, whenever I get the time!
